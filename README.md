# uswds-dark-mode
a hacked dark mode attempt, butchered together with the drupal uswds base stuff
used the nighteye generator app https://nighteye.app/dark-css-generator/ to get started and posted the results to http://fieldmethods.iath.virginia.edu/sawmilling/ which is a basic drupal site using the uswds base theme https://www.drupal.org/project/uswds
